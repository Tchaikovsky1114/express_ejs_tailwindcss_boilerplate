# express_ejs_tailwindcss_boilerplate
## this project installed by express generator + self installed helmet

## Launch
- git clone in [your project]
- npm install
- npm run start
- npm run devcss

**if you need more frontend module(CDN), insert in views/head.cjs**

## CAUTION !

**This boilerplate doesn't use `<% %>` delimiters, it uses `[/ /]` delimiters.**

**Why?**

**This is because the `<% %>` delimiter causes an error in the Code Editor when receiving it from express and using it as a variable in ejs script.**


### Happy Hacking!
